# Find-Your-Hat

This was a project imported from Codecademy that I completed using JavaScript and Node.js, please use Node.js to see the code operate.
+ The game will start you on a randomly generated field.
+ Depending on the size of the field it will generate a certain amount of holes per line.
+ It is then your job to move and find your hat using N,S,E,W directions.
